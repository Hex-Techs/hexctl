# hexctl

A collection of tools used in development

**Motivation**: Some commands of kubectl are too cumbersome. Simplify some commands of kubectl and integrate them with the functions commonly used in high frequency into this tool.

## Goal

- Simplify `kubectl` related config subcommands
- Can use it to generate some kubernetes CRD API code instead of `kubebuilder`
